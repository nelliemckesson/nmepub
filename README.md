nmepub
======

A baby bash script for re-zipping EPUB files. There are a million of these on the internet.

You may need to fix permissions when you clone this down: `chmod 777 /path/to/script/nmepub`

Usage on the command line:

`$ cd /path/to/epub/files/`

`$ /path/to/script/nmepub filename.epub`
